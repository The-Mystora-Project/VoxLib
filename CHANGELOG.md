## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Nothing yet.

## [1.8.0+1.21.1] - 2026-09-17

### Changed

- Reused vanilla bounding-box helpers and removed temporary boxes from debug rendering
- Deprecated the misleading `and` union alias in favor of `+`, preserving its existing behavior and JVM method
- Fixed unions with full cubes discarding geometry outside the block bounds
- Converted the NeoForge entrypoints from Java to Kotlin

- Updated Fabric Loader to 0.19.5, Fabric Language Kotlin to 1.14.1, and Kotlin to 2.4.20
- Updated Loom to 1.18.2 and the build daemon to Java 25; the mod still targets Java 21
- Updated CI checkout, Java setup, and artifact upload actions to their latest release lines

- Ported both Fabric and NeoForge builds to Minecraft 1.21.1
- Updated Fabric API to 0.116.17, NeoForge to 21.1.250, and Mod Menu to 11.0.4
- Updated loader compatibility metadata and the resource pack format for 1.21.1
- Adapted NeoForge config-screen registration to its 1.21.1 API

## [1.7.0+1.20.6] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Added a NeoForge build with bundled Kotlin and Caffeine
- Added NeoForge config-screen and targeted shape-highlight integration

### Changed

- Ported the mod to Minecraft 1.20.6, raising the mod to Java 21 and Fabric API 0.99.4
- Replaced the Forge module with a NeoForge module published as `voxlib-neoforge` via ModDevGradle
- Updated Mod Menu to 10.0.0 and raised the Java requirement to 21

## [1.6.1+1.20.1] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Added a Forge 1.20.1 build with bundled Kotlin and Caffeine
- Added Forge config-screen and targeted shape-highlight integration

### Changed

- Shared client configuration and debug rendering between Fabric and Forge
- Switched development sources to Mojang mappings for both loaders
- Added loader suffixes to distributable filenames; kept Fabric Maven coordinates and added `voxlib-forge`

- Ported the Fabric mod and common library to Minecraft 1.20.1
- Updated Fabric API and Mod Menu for 1.20.1
- Migrated the settings screen to Minecraft's `GuiGraphics` rendering API

## [1.6.1+1.19.4] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Added a manual JMH benchmark suite with vanilla and legacy baselines
- Added exact occupied-volume and JVM API compatibility tests

### Changed

- Replaced list-based operation cache keys with specialized identity keys
- Kept first-use binary union overhead close to vanilla with two-touch admission and a small recent-pair ring
- Made repeated transformation cache hits effectively allocation-free and clear calling-thread fast-path state immediately
- Removed per-box coordinate arrays from shape transformations
- Memoized finite `CommonShapes` parameter combinations and canonicalized chairs without backrests, reducing the maximum slot count from 501 to 321
- Reduced 256-box simplifier allocation from about 10.93 MB/op to 1.88 MB/op with a compact deterministic queue
- Centralized Minecraft 1.19.4 union mechanics for easier future ports

## [1.6.0+1.19.4] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Debug tools infrastructure with client-side support
- `VoxLibConfig` - Validated, persisted client debug settings
- `VoxelShapeDebugClient` - Client-only debug state management
- Client environment guards for `VoxelShapeDebug` rendering methods
- `renderShapeWithConfig()` helper method using client config settings
- Native config screen with debug mode, color, alpha, and reset controls
- Client entrypoint `VoxLibClient` for debug features
- Optional ModMenu integration for config UI access
- Added ModMenu to local Fabric runtime testing
- Independent targeted block outline and collision shape overlays

### Changed

- Updated version to 1.6.0+1.19.4

### Fixed

- Preserved configuration defaults when loading partial JSON
- Serialized configuration updates and file writes
- Kept debug shape transparency independent from configured RGB color
- Added client-side environment guards to prevent server crashes
- Prevented cache hash collisions from returning unrelated shapes
- Handled empty bounding-box simplification and invalid box limits safely
